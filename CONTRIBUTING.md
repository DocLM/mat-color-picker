# Contributing with Material Community Components

## Want a component?

When you are opening a issue to request a component, please follow the struct ```request(component) COMPONENT_NAME```.

Example:

```request(component) DatePicker```

This way, I believe we will reduce the duplication of requests for the same component.

## Want a feature?

If you found the component you are looking for but some feature is missing, please open a issue with the struct ```request(feature:color-picker) FEATURE```
